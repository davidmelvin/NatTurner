						<li>Nat Turner was born on October 2, 1800 in Southampton County, Virginia, to two slaves belonging to Benjamin Turner.</li>
						<li>Turner&#8217;s father was reported to have escaped to the North, and so he was raised by his mother Nancy and paternal grandmother. Both of them instilled a passion for education and freedom in Nat that many other slaves did not have. He showed great signs of intelligence early in life, and became well educated and very religious. He knew that he &#8220;would never be of any service to any one as a slave&#8221;, but that he was &#8220;intended for some great purpose.&#8221;</li>
						<li>Although he was owned by three different masters before he was thirty years old, he lived in Southampton County, Virginia all of his life. Benjamin Turner was his first owner, as his parents were slave to him. In 1809, Benjamin lent Nat and his mother to his son Samuel, but Benjamin died before he could reclaim them. It was for Samuel Turner that Nat began slave work, at the age of twelve.</li>
						<li>In 1822, Nat Turner married another slave named Cherry, but they were separated when they were sold to different masters. Nat was sold to Thomas Moore, who died in 1828. After the death of Thomas Moore, Nat became the property of Thomas' son Putnam Moore. Putnam&#8217;s mother married Joseph Travis in 1829, but Turner was still, technically, owned by nine year-old Putnam Moore.</li>
						<li>In <span class="book">Nat Turner&#8217;s Confessions</span>, which was written by Thomas Gray with Turner&#8217;s answers to questions, Nat recalled an event on May 12, 1828:</li>
						<blockquote>
							<p>I heard a loud noise in the heavens, and the Spirit was loosened, and Christ had laid down the yoke he had borne for the sins of men, and that I should take it on and fight against the Serpent, for the time was fast approaching when the first should be last and the last should be first. (Gray, Turner)</p>
						</blockquote>
						<li>He then that Nat Turner began his work to rebel against slavery. He was executed on November 11, 1831, after his revolt earlier that year.</li>
